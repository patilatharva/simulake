    <h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Cellular Automata (CA) are discrete mathematical models that consist of a grid of cells, where each cell has a finite number of possible states. The states of the cells change over time based on a set of rules that define how the state of a cell is affected by its neighboring cells. Due to its simplicity, CA is used by many computer graphic designers as an alternative to achieve aesthetically appealing simulation of fluids and other physical materials, and to model the complex interactions between materials of varying physical properties. Our project group embarked on the challenge of implementing the CA logic of various materials such as sand, water, and fire, and created scenes where multiple materials interact with each other. Furthermore, we took an extra step and implemented our own renderer that supports both cpu and gpu renderings with significant speedup.

    <h2 align="middle">Technical Approach
    </h2>

    <p>
        We render our scene by treating it as a 2D grid divided into cells, where each cell can contain one of the following cell types: ait, smoke, fire, water, oil, sand, and stone. We also added a way to easily access the 8 surrounding cells of a given cell by calling get_cell_context() function. Furthermore, we created an object for each of the cell types, and at each time step, we iterated through every single cell in the grid, and called the step() function associated with its type to update the grid state in the next time step. In this section we are going to provide details about the rules in the step() function of each material, and go over the technical aspect of our renderer.

    <h4 align="middle">Sand
    </h4>
    <p>
        To simulate falling sand and sand piles, we took inspiration from [source] and implemented the CA rules for sand as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>If the current cell is sand, and the cell right below it is of a fluid type (i.e. air, smoke, fire, water, oil), change the bottom cell into the sand type, and change the type of the current cell into that of the bottom cell.
        </li>
        <li>Else, we check the bottom left cell, and if it is a fluid, repeat the action of the previous step.</li>
        <li>Else, we check the bottom right and update the cell using the same logic accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>If none of the cells below the current cell is fluid, it means the sand particle is stuck, therefore we don’t do anything to the state of the cell.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h4 align="middle">Water
    </h4>
    <p>
        The rules for the behavior of water cells is similar to sand in that it also includes a vertically down flow due to gravity. Yet different from sand, it also includes horizontal equalization with neighboring cells and a slight diagonal flow, thereby having a wider range of motion. The mass of each cell is also taken into account, where a water cell at a lower location has a slightly heavier mass than the water cell at the top. Using the mass property, we were able to simulate water compression, which occurs when the mass exceeds a certain limit, leading to the water flow back upward. These rules can be used to simulate the behavior of water in different conditions and can provide insights into fluid dynamics.

        Oil is very similar to water, except that we added a property where it will always flow above water when it comes in contact with water cells.

    <h4 align="middle">Smoke and Fire
    </h4>
    <p>
        Smoke and fire should be talked about together, because smoke is usually a byproduct of fire interacting with flammable materials. For a fire cell, we look at all of its 8 neighboring cells, and update them using the following logic:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>If the neighboring cell is flammable (the flammable cell types in our project’s definition is sand and oil), change this neighboring cell’s type into fire.
        </li>
        <li>Else, if the neighboring cell is air, it means the fire has lit up but cannot be propagated into the neighboring cell, therefore with probability p, this neighboring cell will turn into smoke, and 1 - p probability of remaining being ari.
        </li>
        <li>If the neighboring cell is water, we want to generate steam. And since steam and water share similar properties, we categorized them all under the smoke type. For water instead of having a probability p, we want to convert all the water cells that came in contact with fire into smoke.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Additionally, the fire cell also has a probability of directly turning into an air cell, indicating that the fire has died down.

    <h4 align="middle">Jet Fuel
    </h4>
    <p>
        In our CA simulation, jet fuel is represented as a type of material that can collide with and flow around other solid objects as well as objects of the same material as itself. The behavior of the fuel is influenced by its surroundings, with a probability of combustion increasing depending on the presence of combustible materials. Once ignited, the fuel will continue to combust on oil, but can be extinguished by water.

    <h4 align="middle">Ghost Fire
    </h4>
    <p>
        The CA logic for simulating ghost fire involves two key rules. First, the fire is similar logic to our earlier implementation of jet fuel,
        but it burns eternally without the need for additional fuel (thereby it's called ghost fire). Second, the fire destroys sand cells when it comes into contact with them, but can be extinguished by water cells.

    </h4>
    <p>
        Stones are represented as static solid materials that are neither affected by other materials nor any laws of physics. In other words, they exist as immovable objects in the simulation, with no interactions or reactions with their surroundings. This simple model can be useful for creating simulations of static environments, such as landscapes or geological formations, where the behavior of stones does not change over time.

    <h4 align="middle">Redering Engine</h4>
    <p>Our rendering engine was written entirely from scratch using C++ and OpenGL. Our OpenGL (glad, glfw, gl), OpenCL (C) and OpenMP (C++) calls are secluded into individual files, which include guards to configure the backend based on compile flags and available support.
    </p>
    <p>We have a backend agnostic GridBase Class for Grid Types, which are responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Storing and maintaining the simulation state
        </li>
        <li>Serialization to disk and deserialization from disk (so that scenes can be saved and replayed)
        </li>
        <li>Providing an API to update state using mouse input and direct function calls.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We experimented with multiple iterations before settling on our final approach:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bind vertices and texture coordinates for a single quad that covers the viewport</li>
        <li>Serialize and pass our grid data to a 1D buffer read by the fragment shader
            <ul>
                <li>(cell_type0, cell_mass0, …, cell_type_n, mass_n)
                </li>
                <li>CPU implementation: we pass this to the fragment shader through glTexImage2D
                </li>
                <li>GPU implementation: we write new state data directly into GPU memory through an OpenCL kernel, avoiding CPU memory transfer entirely
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Sample the grid “texture” in the fragment shader from a GLSL Sampler2D buffer and decode the (cell_type, cell_mass) attributes that correspond to the given pixel (one cell can occupy multiple screen pixels, so we used interpolated texture coordinates from the vertex shader)
        </li>
        <li>Procedurally generate material textures in the fragment shader using pseudo random number generation seeded with gl_FragCoord and mixing various noise functions (we used Voronoi and Fractal Brownian Noise)
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4 align="middle">CPU Implementation</h4>

        <li>copies data into glTexture: encode [cell type, mass] into float value slots of texture, passed to fragment shader.</li>
        <li>utilizes OpenMP to parallelize the main hot loop iterating over cells. Splits the 2D loop into rows to be processed by different threads from a thread pool (retain threads to avoid creation / destruction overheads).

        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 align="middle">GPU Compute Kernels:</h4>
    <p><b>Individual kernels</b> implemented for initialization of grid (defaults to AIR filled grid), random-initialization (for testing / debugging / demo), simulation step, fluid step (second pass helpful for fluids which needs the updated state, to further modify the updated state. executed after simulation step kernel completes), render (encode grid into cl_image, which is connected internally to a glTexture2D), and spawn cells (handle mouse input for spawning and erasing cells).
    </p>
    <p>Data is never directly read nor modified from CPU side, all manipulations to cl_mem buffers storing the grid cells are done on <b>GPU using double buffering</b>.
    </p>
    <p>We just swap the kernel arguments before launch, depending on which grid to use as previous-state, and which for target updated state.
    </p>
    <p>Code involves <b>heavy use of macros</b> for automatic struct, callbacks and function declarations / definitions (inspiration taken from PyTorch codebase), inline function calls and minimized branching.
    </p>
    <p>We added <b>Pseudo Random Number Generation </b>(not supported in any capacity by OpenCL), to make our behaviors more stochastic. This was done by initializing a buffer of random seeds (from C++ stdlib generators) in the GPU, when DeviceGrid is created. Then our random number functions within the OpenCL program, accessed using simple macros, will read in the current cell (row, col) seed, update the seed using Java-Random algorithm (we have support for XOR shift, Mersenne Twister as well), and give a random number. This way, each kernel thread can have its own string of random numbers over time.
    </p>
    <p>We implemented random floating point values, and values between ranges for both integers and floats using this base algorithm. This means we have a one time initialization cost, and get cheap pseudo random number generation.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2 align="middle">Performance & Benchmarking</h2>
    <p>We added our own debugging and benchmarking structures for time and latency measurement, which can be accessed with convenience macros like <b>`PROFILE_SCOPE(“myscope”)` and `PROFILE_FUNCTION()`, `BREAKPOINT()` </b>etc. We used the CMAKE xcode generator to generate xcode project files, and used Xcode profiling tools to help us find bottlenecks and mitigate them, to achieve minimal overhead. </p>
    <p>On the CPU Side, the biggest bottleneck is <b>`grid.type_at`</b> which reads a cell from the 2D grid of cells, and returns its type. This is where 53% of our time is spent, waiting for data to load in. We brought this time down from ~70% by using aligned and packed structs. We maintain >100 fps for resolutions up to 1080p, beyond which we get a performance cliff.
    </p>
    <p>On the GPU Side, the biggest bottleneck is <b>`glfwSwapBuffers` </b>call which takes ~55% of total time. Even when operating on big world sizes: eg: at 8M cells (4K resolution), we are able to simulate a full scene and compute the next frame, even before the display is ready to receive the next frame after displaying it (resolutions up to 4k all run pretty much >200 fps all the time, we did not test it further, but the profiling data is encouraging and points we have more bandwidth & capacity to exploit with the current implementation).

    <h2 align="middle"> Problems Encountered and Lessons Learned</h2>

    <br>

    <h3>1. Lagging Support for Velocity Attribute</h3>
    <p>Problem: Initially, a pixel could only move 1 pixel max, in 1 sim step, but this made water appear very viscous, almost like honey.</p>
    <p>
        Solution: We added a parameter horizontal_reach to allow liquids to spread across n horizontal neighbors in a single time step.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Race Conditions</h3>
    <p>no particular order of cell processing on GPU  / Multithreaded CPU, leads to loss of mass / particles due to concurrent overwrites into the next state being computed
    </p>
    <p>We initially wanted to maintain the invariance that a grid cell can read previous state from the entire grid, but cannot update the next state for any other cell indices, ie. a cell can only update itself depending on its neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>We quickly ran into issues with this restriction, when implementing water which has multiple directions of flow of mass, and a single water cell can be filled in by multiple neighboring water cells.
    </p>
    <p>On CPU we decided to deal with this by splitting workgroups into rows, as this was the most prominent access pattern (achieved by our water logic)
    </p>
    <p>On GPU we decided to deal with this by splitting work groups into chunks of 10x10, within which we tolerate race-conditions and compensate for the lost mass and particles. Towards the deadline, we added another Simulation Pass just for fluids, who need to read the updated state, to update the state further (eg: water needs to know where water is right now, to handle its flow edge cases), but were not able to adapt our fluids to take advantage of this in time.</p>

    <h3>3. Oil - Water Interaction
    </h3>
    <p>Problem: an oil cell found below a water cell should swap places, but we always ran into undefined behavior because the oil-water swap would face a race condition with regular oil/water flow.</p>
    <p>Solution: we decided to implement another GPU grid pass just for vertically swapping fluids of different densities so it wouldn’t conflict with regular flow.
    </p>

    <h3>4. GPU PRNG issues
    </h3>
    <p>Problem: OpenCL doesn’t have a random number generator, but we needed one to model behavior like sand spread, flame/smoke rise and sand erosion.
    </p>
    <p>Solution: We created a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) based on an initial seed matrix of random numbers, row/col number, mass and hashing.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial attempt was to use (row, col, mass) as a seed, but this was not unique enough because of correlation of nearby cells
        </li>
        <li>We ended up using the sophisticated PRNG setup elaborated above. This results in much better visuals and finer grained control over behaviors.
        </li>
    </ul>

        We desired a cross platform software,
        so we had to stick with the OpenGL version we had available on all our devices (MacBooks).
        We avoided Metal due to its specificity to MacOS, and Vulkan was not chosen for this project, we required a very basic renderer and the verbosity of Vulkan is not justified for our scale of application. Furthermore, we are happy with single threaded render loops, and so did not require any of the additional capabilities offered by the other APIs.</p>

    <h4>Q. What was the need for GPU accelerated simulation, despite also having a CPU Multi Threaded Version?</h4>
    <p>We wanted to implement an engine for CA simulation, with vast capabilities in terms of Number Of Cells being simulated with High FPs. We hit a point on the CPU Version where the memory access latency for just reading and writing to our internal grid representation (despite using Packed Aligned Structs optimized for Cache), was the biggest bottleneck of the program. We decided to add a GPU implementation after realizing the performance roof of the CPU version, as well as profiling the program to not be fully utilizing the GPU resources already available.
    </p>

    <h4>Q. Why Use OpenCL at all? Why not do simulation logic in Fragment shader, which is a standard Approach?</h4>
    <p>
        OpenGL 3.3 doesn’t support glBuffers, and even writable-textures. Initially we were using vertex attributes to pass in the relevant data for rendering. We hit a ceiling because of the limited number & sizes of these, conflicting with our desire to support more attributes than just Mass (velocity, updated bit etc). We figured out a way to pass more data in using non-writable Textures instead (16Kx16K limit), but the lack of glBuffers, writable buffers/textures, and lack of any support for Compute Shaders lead us to pivot our simulation engine to OpenCL.
    </p>
    <p>
        We implemented all our materials in OpenCL kernels, and optimized the OpenCL - OpenGL interop in a cross-platform manner such that the CA Grids internal representation is allocated and stored completely in GPU memory, and a special OpenCL kernel can render our grid into a glTexture / Image directly by using the gl resource pointer. This means no copies are made even within GPU memory, no data is copied into CPU, and these GPU buffers can be HOST_READ_ONLY for better performance. All the CPU does in our latest implementation is launch the async OpenCL simulation and render kernels, and then complete a render pass using OpenGL where the target texture is already filled in. Our main render loop is just 1 line of code, drawing our screen size quad, with our computed texture.
