# simulake

#### Getting started
- [ ] Understand cellular automata theory.
- [ ] Compile a list of technical requirements (for CPU/GPU accelaration, CMake, etc.)
- [ ] Start a CMake project with Boost.
- [ ] Define the rules for the automata and define functions for updating the state of the automata based on those rules.

#### Technical
- [ ] Draft a high level design doc.
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit
